Game AI programming may be the most difficult part in game development. Because the creativity of players and designers is limitless, 
there is always a new idea that looks great but needs a better AI function. 

I am not that familiar with AI programming, but when I began to learn it, I found much more questions instead of more understanding. 
So I started a tech article series, help myself study game AI and share what I've learned to other people at the same time. I have read the book 
*Practical Game AI Programming*, and some examples in this project can be found in that book. You can use this project as references when 
study the book.
